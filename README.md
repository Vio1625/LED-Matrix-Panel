# LED-Matrix-Panel


This little project is a small part of a big project I have made with three classmates. The goal of this project was to create a network capable of displaying the number of available parking spaces. 

In this part of the project, I use a RGB Led Matrix Panel to display the available parking spaces.

***Parking closed***

To inform people that the car  park is closed (more than 29 parking spaces used), I decided to create a red frame in which I wrote "Parking complet" which means parking closed.

***Parking available***

To inform people the number of availble parking spaces, I decided to create a green frame in which I wrote "Parking ouvert"
